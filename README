Instructions for Running:
cat file | pipe.pl [flags]

Product Description:
Perl script written by Andrew Nisbet for Edmonton Public Library, distributable by the enclosed license.
Usage notes for /s/sirsi/Unicorn/Bincustom/pipe.pl. This application is a accumulation of helpful scripts 
that performs common tasks on pipe-delimited files. The count function (-c), for example counts the number 
of non-empty values in the specified columns. Other functions work similarly. Stacked functions are 
operated on in alphabetical order by flag letter, that is, if you elect to order columns and trim 
columns, the columns are first ordered, then the columns are trimmed, because -o comes before -t.

Things pipe.pl can do.
1) Trim arbitrary fields.
2) Order and suppress output of arbitrary fields.
3) Randomize all, or a specific sample size of the records from input.
4) De-duplicate records from input.
5) Count non-empty fields from input records.
6) Summation over non-empty numeric values of arbitrary fields.
7) Sort input lines based on one or more arbitrary fields.

A note on usage; because of the way this script works it is quite possible to produce mystifying results. 
For example, failing to remember that ordering comes before trimming may produce perplexing results. 
You can do multiple transformations, but if you are not sure you can pipe output from one process to another pipe process. 
If you order column so that column 1 is output then column 0, but column 0 needs to be trimmed you would have to write:
  cat file | pipe.pl -o"c1,c0" -t"c1"
because -o will first order the row, so the value you want trimmed is now c1. If that is too radical to contemplate then:
  cat file | pipe.pl -t"c0" | pipe.pl -o"c1,c0"

Repository Information:
This product is under version control using Git.

Dependencies:
None

Known Issues:
Using -r with a value of 0% has no effect, that is, all entries are output without randomization.
